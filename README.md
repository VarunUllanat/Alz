# Transcriptomic Analysis of the brains of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Patients

Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (Asym-AD) is a condition where patients have intact cognition but neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Studying the genome-wide expression of transcripts in Asym-AD brains could help us understand the molecular mechanisms that play a role in the onset of AD
Microarray expression counts from the brain is taken for AD, Asym-AD and Normal (control) patients collected from the GEO database and analysis was done (DGE, ORA, GSEA, PPIN).
Neuronal pathways were affected in all cases, and some interesting pathways such as Cytokine signalling was found to be altered in the Asymptomatic AD versus control case.
